# RPS-Multiplayer

In this rock-paper-scissors game, two users are able to play simultaneously. This is done using Google's Firebase database. The choice that each player makes is pushed to the database. After the result is determined using a function, the result is logged into Firebase. The scores are kept updated in the database. The chat function is also using the Firebase database. The messages each user types gets pushed into the database. It is then retrieved, using Firebase functions, and posted into the chat area. Adding users also uses a database. Each users name is logged along with wins, losses, and ties.
